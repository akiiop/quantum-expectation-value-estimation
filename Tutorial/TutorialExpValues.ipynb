    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring [expectation values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_value_(quantum_mechanics)) of [observables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable#Quantum_mechanics) is an essential task in  quantum experiments and quantum algorithms, for example, [Quantum Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_neural_network) (QNN), the [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver) (VQE) and the [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms) (QAOA) . These hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are one of the leading candidates for obtaining quantum advantage in the current era. However, they may require such high precision in estimating the expectation values of observables that makes them impractical due to the many sources of noise in current quantum hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173) we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that estimates the expectation value of observables acting on pure states. This algorithm, like the method presented in [2] is effective for concentrated states, i.e., when only a small number of amplitudes in a measurement basis are non-negligible, a property often satisfied for Molecular Hamiltonians. Moreover, this algorithm improves the one presented in [2], since it is also designed to be effective for Hamiltonian depending on Pauli strings that contain a small fixed number of $X$ and $Y$ Pauli operators, a property that molecular Hamiltonians often satisfy. By exploiting this property, the algorithm works properly with non-concentrated states. The algorithm has an efficient use of classical memory and computational time, and it does not depend on the number of Pauli strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm is implemented in Qiskit and detailed in this tutorial, which provides the theoretical framework and numerical simulations to evaluate its performance."

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The current generation of quantum processors [[3]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/) is characterized by limited numbers of qubits, low gate fidelities, short coherence times, and noise processes that limit circuit depth. In this context, VQAs are one of the best hopes for obtaining quantum advantage. These algorithms typically utilize quantum computers to measure expectation values of observables for a given state using parametrized [quantum circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit). However, precisely estimating these expectation values requires numerous [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics) repetitions to reduce statistical fluctuation. Many applications require such high precision, that VQA algorithms are impractical due to the enormous amount of time needed. For instance, quantum chemical calculations require the so-called chemical accuracy of $ 1 \\textrm{ kcal/mol } \\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ Hartree, making the VQE method non-viable even for a small number of molecules [[4]](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033154).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to measure the expectation values of observables efficiently and implement it on Qiskit. This algorithm is designed to be effective when the state is pure and concentrated, and also when the observable depends on Pauli strings that contain a small fixed number of $X$ and $Y$ Pauli operators. The approach is based on the paper [Quantum expectation-value estimation by computational basis sampling](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173) and includes improvements such as a reduction in the number of C-NOT gates used and the estimated number of coefficients. To explain the algorithm, this tutorial briefly describes the computation of the expectation values of observables. The algorithm's functioning is then described, and its implementation in Qiskit is shown using instructive examples. Moreover, we assess its performance by replicating the results obtained in [2] and expanding the research by computing expectation values of observables for non-concentrated states. Finally, we illustrate how to implement the VQE method for a molecular Hamiltonian."

Despite these efforts, the measurement counts for practical applications are not significantly reduced."

    "\n",
    "We can improve the estimation in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.   If we know that the number of $X$ + $Y$ terms $t$ in a Pauli string $P$ is fixed, then all the terms $\\langle k  | P | j \\rangle$ such that the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) $\\mathrm{dist}_H (k, j) \\neq t$ are zero. For example, $\\langle 000| XYZ |111\\rangle = i\\langle 000| 001 \\rangle = 0$. Then we only need to measure bases that contain terms of the form $| j \\rangle \\pm |k \\rangle$ and $| j \\rangle \\pm i|k \\rangle$ such that $\\mathrm{dist}_H (j, k) = t$. The total number of basis is $K_t = 2\\frac{n!}{(n-t)!t!} \\ll d$, and we define a new POVM $E_t$ sampling from these bases and with normalization factor $K_t$. These basis require $t-1$ CNOT gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.   If we know that our state is concentrated, that is, $|\\psi \\rangle \\approx \\sum_{r=1}^{R} c_{i_r} |i_r \\rangle$, where $R \\ll d$ is a fixed number, and $|c_{i_1}|^2 \\geq |c_{i_2}|^2 \\dots \\geq |c_{i_R}|^2 \\geq \\max\\{|c_{i}|^2: i \\neq i_r \\text{ for each } r=1\\dots R\\}$, then the only non-vanishing terms will be the $c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^{*}$. This means that we only have to measure the $K_R \\leq 2R(R-1)+1$ bases that contain terms of the form $| i_r \\rangle \\pm |i_r' \\rangle$ and $| i_r \\rangle \\pm i| i_r' \\rangle$ and define a POVM $E_R$ that contains these basis and the normalization factor $K_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pauli strings of molecular Hamiltonians mapped to qubits using Jordan Wigner usually contain $0$, $2$ or $4$ $X + Y$ Paulis. Then, we can use (1) with these observables. Also, their ground states are usually highly concentrated. Then, we can use (2). This means that we only have to measure a POVM $E_{Rt}$ that samples from the basis in the intersection of $E_t$ and $E_r$, with a normalization factor $K_{Rt} < K_t, K_r$. Since we are measuring less bases, we can assign more shots to each one of them, reducing the variance and then improving the estimation. "

    "### 3.2 The method\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the above idea we reproduce the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ on quantum computers, and measure it in the computational basis $\\{| i \\rangle : i = 0,1,2^n-1\\}$ with a number $L_f$ of shots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the outcomes of the measurement we  pick up the most frequent R elements such that $1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2$ is lower than some previously defined tolerance $\\mathrm{Tol}$ ($\\approx 10^{-4}$). Next, we sort in descending order of frecuency the selected elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determine the set of numbers of $X$ and $Y$ gates in the Pauli strings of the observable to reduce the number of coefficients in the estimation. Usually for molecular Hamiltonians we have $0, 2$ and $4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measure The POVM $E_{Rt}$ and compute the non-negligible coefficientes $|c_{i_r}|^2$ , $2\\,\\mathrm{Re}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ and $2\\,\\mathrm{Im}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ as a sample mean of the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The described method inherits the performance properties shown in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173). First, the error in estimating  $\\langle \\psi  | O | \\psi \\rangle$ produced by  approximating  the quantum estate by $| \\psi_R\\rangle$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2}$. Next, the number of measurements necessary to attain some precision in the standard deviation of the approximation is fewer than that of the alternative techniques. Moreover, the described method improves that reported in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173), since the method works properly for non-concentrated states, and the number of CNOT gates employed is not $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, but is equal to the number of $X$ and $Y$ gate in the Pauli strings of the observable."

    "## 7. Discussion and outlook\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to measure the expectation values of observables efficiently and implement it on Qiskit. This algorithm is designed to be effective when the state is pure and concentrated, and also when the observable depends on Pauli strings that contain a small fixed number of $X$ and $Y$ Pauli operators. These objects are interesting for instance in  Quantum Chemistry.  The approach presents some improvements to that presented in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173) like the proper operation for non-concatenated states, a reduction in the number of CNOT gates used, and a reduction in the estimated number of coefficients. These new method features enable us to implement the VQE method, which is a significant aim in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    " By construction,  the method has an efficient use of classical memory and computational time, and it does not depend on the number of Pauli strings. Furthermore, from the numerical simulation, we see that the method uses fewer shots compared to the alternative methods (see ref.[2]). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are some improvements that could be made on the algorithm implementation:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Implementing the algorithm in Qiskit is not yet fully polished, as some subroutines are not optimally implemented, causing the program to run slower and consume more resources. \n",
    " \n",
    " - The estimator's variance has a closed form, calculated by the program. However, we were not able to perform numerical simulations\n",
    " \n",
    " - The optimal allocation of the measurement budget was not used because it did not affect the estimation outcome.  We can deduce from this that some minor error caused the program to malfunction.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The VQE implementation does not support higher molecules, since the ansatz...\n",
