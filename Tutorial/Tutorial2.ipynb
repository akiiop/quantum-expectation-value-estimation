    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring [expectation values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_value_(quantum_mechanics)) of [observables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable#Quantum_mechanics) is an essential task in algorithms in quantum computing, for example, Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-021-00348-9). These hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are one of the leading candidates for obtaining quantum advantage in the current era. However, these algorithms require such high precision in estimating the expectation values of observables that make them impractical due to the many sources of noisy in current hardware. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we deal with the efficient measurement of the expectation values of observables acting on concentrated states, i.e., when only a small number of amplitudes in a measurement basis are non-negligible. This is accomplished using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on a novel procedure described in [[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver) that includes improvements like reducing the number of CNOT gates employed and the estimated number of parameters. Our algorithm is supported in Qiskit and detailed in this tutorial, which provides the theoretical framework and numerical simulations to evaluate its performance."

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The current generation of quantum processors [[3]](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2018-08-06-79/). is characterized by limited numbers of qubits, low gate fidelities, short coherence times, and noise processes that limit circuit depth. In this context, the VQAs is the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. These algorithms typically utilize quantum computers to measure expectation values of observables for a given state using parametrized [quantum circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit). However, precisely estimating these expectation values requires numerous [measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics) repetitions to reduce statistical fluctuation. Many applications require such high precision, that VQA algorithms are impractical due to the enormous amount of time needed. For instance, quantum chemical calculations require the so-called chemical accuracy of $ 1 \\textrm{ kcal/mol } \\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ Hartree, making the [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver) (VQE) method non-viable even for a small number of molecules [[4]](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033154).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we implement a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm supported on Qiskit to measure the expectation values of observables efficiently. This algorithm is designed to be effective when the state is pure and concentrated, which is a family of quantum states with many interesting practical applications, such as in Quantum Chemistry. The approach is based on the paper [Quantum expectation-value estimation by computational basis sampling](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173) and includes improvements such as a reduction in the number of CNOT gates used and the estimated number of parameters. To explain the algorithm, this tutorial briefly describes the computation of the expectation values of observables. The algorithm's functioning is then described, and its implementation in Qiskit is shown using instructive examples. Moreover, we assess its performance by calculating the resources required to achieve a fixed accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how to implement the VQE method for a molecular Hamiltonian."

Despite these efforts, the measurement counts for practical applications are not significantly reduced."

    "1.   If we know that the number of $X$ + $Y$ terms $t$ in a Pauli string $P$ is fixed, then all the terms $\\langle k  | P | j \\rangle$ such that the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) $\\mathrm{dist}_H (k, j) \\neq t$ are zero.

Then we only need to measure bases that contain terms of the form $| j \\rangle \\pm |k \\rangle$ and $| j \\rangle \\pm i|k \\rangle$ such that $\\mathrm{dist}_H (j, k) = t$. The total number of basis is $K_t = 2\\frac{n!}{(n-t)!t!} \\ll d$, and we define a new POVM $E_t$ sampling from these bases and with normalization factor $K_t$. These basis require $t-1$ CNOT gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.   If we know that our state is concentrated, that is, $|\\psi \\rangle \\approx \\sum_{r=1}^{R} c_{i_r} |i_r \\rangle$, where $R \\ll d$ is a fixed number, and $|c_{i_1}|^2 \\geq |c_{i_2}|^2 \\dots \\geq |c_{i_R}|^2 \\geq tolerance$, then the only non-vanishing terms will be the $c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^{*}$.

Also, their ground states are usually highly concentrated. Then, we can use (2). This means that we only have to measure a POVM $E_{Rt}$ that samples from the basis in the intersection of $E_t$ and $E_r$, with a normalization factor $K_{Rt} < K_t, K_r$. Since we are measuring less bases, we can assign more shots to each one of them, reducing the variance and then improving the estimation. "

    "### 3.2 The method\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the above idea we reproduce the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ on quantum computers, and measure it in the computational basis $\\{| i \\rangle : i = 0,1,2^n-1\\}$ with a number $L_f$ of shoots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the outcomes of the measurement we  pick up the most frequent R elements such that $1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2$ is lower than some previously defined tolerance $\\mathrm{Tol}$ ($\\approx 10^{-4}$). Next, we sort in descending order of frecuency the selected elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determine the number of $X$ and $Y$ gates in the Pauli string to reduce the number of coefficients in the estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measure The POVM $E$ and compute the non-negligible coefficientes $|c_{i_r}|^2$ , $2\\,\\mathrm{Re}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ and $2\\,\\mathrm{Im}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ as a sample mean of the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The described method inherits the performance properties shown in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173). First, the error in estimating  $\\langle \\psi  | O | \\psi \\rangle$ produced by  approximating  the quantum estate by $| \\psi_R\\rangle$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2}$. Next, the number of measurements necessary to attain some precision in the standard deviation of the approximation is fewer than that of the alternative techniques. Moreover, the described method improves that reported in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173), since the number of CNOT gates employed is not $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, but is equal to the number of $X$ and $Y$ gate in the Pauli string."

    "We implement a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm supported by Qiskit to efficiently measure the expectation values of observables. This algorithm is effective when the state is concentrated, a very interesting family of quantum states in practical application, for instance, Quantum Chemistry. The approach presents some improvements to that presented in [[2]](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.033173) like a reduction in the number of CNOT gates used and a reduction in the estimated number of parameters. The implementation of the algorithm in Qiskit is detailed in this tutorial, where several numerical simulations evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some improvements that could be made on the algorithm implementation:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Implementing the algorithm in Qiskit is not yet fully polished, as some subroutines are not optimally implemented, causing the program to run slower and consume more resources. \n",
    " \n",
    " - The estimator's variance has a closed form, calculated by the program. However, we were not able to perform numerical simulations\n",
    " \n",
    " - The optimal allocation of the measurement budget was not used because it did not affect the estimation outcome.  We can deduce from this that some minor error caused the program to malfunction.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The VQE implementation does not support higher molecules, since the ansatz...\n",
