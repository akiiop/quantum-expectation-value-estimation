    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The current generation of quantum processors is characterized by limited numbers of qubits, low gate fidelities, short coherence times, and noise processes that limit circuit depth. In this context, the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) is the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Those hybrid quantum-classical algorithms typically utilize quantum computers to measure expectation values of observables for a given state realized by a parametrized quantum circuit. However, precisely estimating these expectation values requires numerous measurement repetitions to reduce statistical fluctuation. Many applications require such high precision that VQA algorithms are impractical due to the enormous amount of time needed. For instance, quantum chemical calculations require the so-called chemical accuracy of $ 1 \\textrm{ kcal/mol } \\approx 1.6 \\times 10^{-3}$ Hartree, making the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) method non-viable even for a small number of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we provide a Python package that implements a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to measure the expectation values of observables efficiently. The algorithm is based on the paper \"Quantum expectation-value estimation by computational basis sampling\" and designed to be effective when the state is concentrated, i.e., when only a small number of amplitudes in a measurement basis are non-negligible. Several quantum states of practical importance are concentrated, and they often emerge  in quantum chemistry problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial starts with a brief explanation of the computation of the expectation values of observables. Next, we explain how to use the supplied package using instructive examples. Moreover, we assess its performance by measuring the resources required to achieve a fixed accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how to implement the VQE method for a molecular Hamiltonian."

    "There are several studies to reduce the number of measurements to estimate expectation values of observables.

    "### 3.2 The method\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the above idea we reproduce the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Prepare the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ on quantum computers, and measure it in the computational basis $\\{| i \\rangle : i = 0,1,2^n-1\\}$ with a number $L_r$ of shoots.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) From the outcomes of the measurement we  pick up the most frequent R elements such that $1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2$ be lower of some previusly defined tolerance $Tol$ ($Tol\\approx 10^{-4}$). Next, we sort in descending order of frecuency the selected elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii) Determine the number of body interactions for the system to reduce the number of coefficients in the estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) Measure The POVM $E$ and compute the non-negligible coefficientes $|c_{i_r}|^2$ , $2\\mathrm{Re}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ and $2\\mathrm{Im}(c_{i_r} c_{i_r'}^*)$ as a sample mean of the outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The described method inherits the performance properties shown in (cita paper). First, the error in estimating  $\\langle \\psi  | O | \\psi \\rangle$ produced by  approximating  the quantum estate by $| \\psi_R\\rangle$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{1-|\\langle \\psi_R | \\psi \\rangle|^2}$. Next, the number of measurements necessary to attain some precision in the standard deviation of the approximation is fewer than that of the alternative techniques. Moreover, the described method improves to that shown in (cita paper), since the number of CNOT gates employed is not $\\mathcal{O}(d)$, but is equal to the maximum number of body interactions."
